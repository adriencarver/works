                It’s Elizabeth London’s 100th birthday, and it’s the last day of her life. Over the course of her century on earth, she’s seen cataclysmic changes that have driven humanity into a beautiful yet confining underground global civilization. Her emotionally-minded omnibot—her EMO, assigned as her digital hospice nurse— helps her sort through her belongings in preparation for her final transition to the Epicity.<br><br>
                Of all the items she must leave behind, Elizabeth holds onto one: a mix CD made for her in 2006 by her first boyfriend. She hasn’t listened to it in decades, but today, on her final day, she will. As each song plays, Elizabeth revisits the moments of her first year of college, reliving the joy, pain, and hope of the end of her first love. Along the way, three strange traveling companions appear, each one connected to the journey she’s about to take.<br><br>
                As the music guides her through her past, Elizabeth must confront what it means to truly let go—and whether love, like songs, can truly transcend time and space.
